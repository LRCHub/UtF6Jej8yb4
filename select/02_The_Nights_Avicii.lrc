[00:02.82] Once upon a younger year
[00:04.44] When all our shadows disappeared
[00:06.40] The animals inside came out to play
[00:10.24] Went face to face with all our fears
[00:12.20] Learned our lessons through the tears
[00:13.95] Made memories we knew would never fade
[00:17.41] One day, my father, he told me, “Son, don't let it slip away”
[00:21.67] He took me in his arms, I heard him say
[00:25.05] “When you get older your wild heart will live for younger days
[00:29.44] Think of me if ever you're afraid”
[00:32.55] He said, “One day, you'll leave this world behind
[00:36.45] So live a life you will remember”
[00:40.20] My father told me when I was just a child
[00:43.91] “These are the nights that never die”
[00:47.32] My father told me
[00:55.82] 
[01:18.79] “When thunderclouds start pouring down
[01:20.87] Light a fire they can't put out
[01:22.85] Carve your name into those shining stars”
[01:25.94] He said, “Go venture far beyond the shores
[01:28.51] Don't forsake this life of yours
[01:30.25] I'll guide you home no matter where you are”
[01:33.60] One day, my father, he told me, “Son, don't let it slip away”
[01:37.88] When I was just a kid, I heard him say
[01:41.26] “When you get older your wild heart will live for younger days
[01:45.48] Think of me if ever you're afraid”
[01:48.84] He said, “One day, you'll leave this world behind
[01:52.48] So live a life you will remember”
[01:56.32] My father told me when I was just a child
[02:00.15] “These are the nights that never die”
[02:03.46] My father told me
[02:11.96] 
[02:15.48] “These are the nights that never die”
[02:18.72] My father told me
[02:27.22] 
[02:49.25] My father told me

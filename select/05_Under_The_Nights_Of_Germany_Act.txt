The clock sounds the hour
The hour of pure sorrow
I'm no longer in your world
I will be back tomorrow

Under the nights of Germany
Under the nights of Germany
What language did I speak?

My days are damned
I move on
Saying farewell
What heart shall I shatter next?
The world marches on

Under the nights of Germany
Under the nights of Germany
What language did I speak?

(German words)

Saying farewell

Under the nights of Germany
Under the nights of Germany
What language did I speak?

(German words)

Under the nights of Germany
Under the nights of Germany
(Repeat to fade)

I was hoping, could you be my inspiration
Whatever should become in the candlelight
I was dreaming, was it my imagination
Tomorrow never comes in the candlelight

When the night's on fire
Do you need love's arms to hold you
It's a flame there burns no finer
When you see one bird
There's another watching over
And the two can fly much higher

I was listening, to the wind that walks the hours
I never would have heard
In the candlelight
I was hoping, would you shelter me from showers
I believe every word in the candlelight

When the night's on fire and you burn
Like a flame that's burning in the rain
Do you need somewhere to turn
When you see one bird
It's the two that fly higher
And a second in heaven's worth whole life's
Trouble and trial

Ever since the day I left you
To live the dream that's in my heart
I've been lonely babe though I make it through the days
When I turn out the lights
There's a feeling I can't fight
I promise this won't be forever
I hated leaving you alone
I had to take a chance and find myself out there
Still I lay awake in bed
Thoughts of you fill my head

I swear the nights of my own
Just may be the hardest thing I've ever known
With your picture by my side
I'm all alone
I swear the nights are gonna get me
I swear the nights are gonna get me

I hear your voice on the line
I close my eyes to feel you near
Even though I miss you babe
This is what I gonna do
Unkempt the hours are gone
How am I supposed to carry on?

I swear the nights of my own
Just may be the hardest thing I've ever known
With your picture by my side
I'm all alone
I swear the nights are gonna get me
I swear the nights are gonna get me

Nothing else feels so right
Than holding you all through the night
Until the day we'll be together
Hold my babe, I'm going crazy

I swear the nights of my own
Just may be the hardest thing I've ever known
With your picture by my side
I'm all alone
I swear the nights are gonna get me
Baby

I swear the nights of my own
Just may be the hardest thing I've ever known
With your picture by my side
I'm all alone
I swear the nights are gonna get me
I swear the nights are gonna get me

I swear the nights of my own
Just may be the hardest thing I've ever known
With your picture by my side
I'm all alone
